        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            This page documents features of ##gupshup's bot, ChaiWala 
            ("tea-server"). ChaiWala runs a modified version of the IRC bot
            CloudBot. Amongst the modifications made to ChaiWala include a
            virtual currency system, described in more detail below.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that the full list of commands for ChaiWala is not given below;
            for that, you should consult the
            <a href="https://snoonet.org/gonzobot">Snoonet page on gonzobot</a>,
            which is a version of CloudBot customised for Snoonet. Some commands
            listed on that page may not be present in ChaiWala because ChaiWala
            runs a slightly older version of CloudBot. If you would like to see
            ChaiWala be updated with a particular command, contact <em>hasc</em>
            on ##gupshup.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this documentation, command parameters are surrounded by angle
            brackets ("&lt;" and "&gt;") to indicate that they are compulsory,
            and square brackets if optional.

        <h2>The Virtual Currency System</h2>

        <p>
            A rudimentary virtual currency system has been implemented into
            ChaiWala. It allows users to exchange a currency known as
            <em>coins</em>. At the moment, the only thing you may do with coins
            is purchase the removal of your own grabs (for a cost of 10 coins
            per grab, as documented below), but soon you will be able to trade
            ducks and other items for coins. Coins can be obtained by
            participating in the channel. Each time you post a message to the
            channel, there is a 1 in 1000 chance that the bot dishes out a coin
            to you.
        </p>

        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>Syntax</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>.openaccount</code></td>
                <td>Opens an account in your name, after which you will be
                    able to hold coins and exchange them with other users.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>.balance [nick] </code></td>
                <td>Shows <code>[nick]</code>'s current balance, in coins. If 
                    <code>[nick]</code> is left blank, this will simply display
                    your own balance.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>.coinstotal, .totalcoins</code></td>
                <td>Shows the total number of coins currently in circulation.
                    This is the sum of all coins possessed by users.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>.give &lt;nick&gt; &lt;quantity&gt;</td>
                <td>Transfers <code>&lt;quantity&gt;</code> coins from your
                    balance into <code>&lt;nick&gt;</code>'s balance. This will
                    not work if <code>&lt;nick&gt;</code> does not have an
                    account (the command will display a message indicating
                    this). Channel operators may specify a negative value for
                    <code>&lt;quantity&gt;</code> to take coins from a
                    particular nick.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>.richest</code></td>
                <td>Shows the richest nicks in the channel: a list of all nicks
                    with accounts and their corresponding balances sorted in
                    descending order.</td>

        <h2>Markov Chain Generator</h2>

        <p>
            You can have the bot feed all previous messages in the channel from a
            particular nick into a Markov chain generator and then output a
            random message from it. To make use of this feature, simply type
            <code>&lt;nick&gt;_bot</code> (e.g. <code>hasc_bot</code>) and the
            bot will respond with a randomly generated message. You may also type
            <code>?_bot</code> to pick a random nick, or <code>grabs_bot</code>
            to feed all previous grabs into the Markov chain generator instead.
        </p>

        <h2>Miscellaneous Commands</h2>

        <p>
            Use <code>.platts &lt;word&gt;</code> to consult Platts' dictionary
            for a particular Urdu word. You can type the word in Roman Urdu but
            it tends to work best if you write it in the Urdu script. By
            default, the first definition will be returned but you can view
            subsequent definitions by adding a space followed by a number,
            as so: <code>.platts &lt;word&gt; 2</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Use <code>.cricket</code> to see the latest cricket scores. The code
            for this command was written a long time and might take a long time
            to return its output. Sometimes it might not work altogether, so
            tread carefully.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some other fun<sup>1</sup> commands include, but
            are not limited to, <code>.kek</code>, <code>.nep</code>, and
            <code>.konishiki</code>.
            <br />
            <sup>1</sup> Definitions of "fun" may vary.
